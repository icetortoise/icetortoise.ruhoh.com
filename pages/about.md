Hi there, my name is Andy, and this is my blog site.

I'm interested in 
* (functional)programming
* mathematics(especially probability and statistics)
* data analysis 
* and anything that put these things together.

All posts in these areas will be written in English.

I'm a Chinese who lives in Montreal, Canada. 
I am still in the process of exploring this beautiful country, and I will be trying to record interesting stuff in this blog, and all these will be written in Chinese.

You can find me through icetortoise #At# gmail.com
